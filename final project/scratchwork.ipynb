We find that there are no missing values \nin the launch data and country features. On the other hand, there are 901 missing values in each numerical \nfeature (which is not incredibly high, given that there are over 40,000 total observatons). We analyze these \nand find that the missing values are not random: they all come from the same 901 observations.\nWhen we subset these out from the full dataframe, we find that they correspond to just a few _types_ of observations\n(as described by the COMMENTS). For example, some of them correspond to space objects that are in solarcentric orbit.\nThis means they do not orbit the earth, but rather the sun. Other categories include lunarcentric objects, \nobjects in Mars orbit, and objects that have made impact with Venus. Therefore, the values for apogee, perigee, \ninclination, and period are missing because they cannot be calculated -- they do not apply for objects not \ncurrently in Earth orbit. We thus decide to not impute for our missing data. Rather, we drop these rows as they \ndo not factor into our analysis of space debris _surrounding Earth_.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-d302d595-a6b6-48bc-95e1-745e6ed205e4","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We evaluated the distributions of our numerical predictors, running .describe() in order to attain mean,\nstandard deviation, and quartiles. We note immediately that our data is wildly skewed. The standard deviation\nof the APOGEE datapoints is about 14,000; PERIGEE's is about 7,300. As another indicator: \nWhile the third quartile for APOGEE is 1011, the max value is almost 700,000. INCLINATION shows far less spread,\nalthough PERIOD has a similarly wide gap between the top of its interquartile range and its max value: about 95,400.\nThus, before plotting our distributions and moving ahead with our analysis, we determine the outlier values. Employing\nthe common outlier quantification (Q3 + (1.5* IQR), Q1 - (1.5*IQR)), we determine that there are over 5,000 \"outlier\"\nvalues in both the APOGEE and PERIOD features, and another 2,925 in PERIGEE (none in INCLINATION, as expected). Of\ncourse, we do expect there to be high overlap in the outliers from each feature (ie a satellite with high APOGEE \nshould also have high PERIGEE, unless it has a very elliptical orbit). When we plot the numerical datapoints sans\noutliers, we find the above violin plot distributions. APOGEE and PERIGEE are still right skewed; PERIOD and INCLINATION\nhave much narrower spreads. The bulk of APOGEE's points are between about 0 and 500, while PERIGEE's are between\nabout 0 and 250. Even though we don't drop the rows with outliers (as we still need data on those launches for our\nother analyses), this evaluation of outliers is important for our graphing below (in which we restrict the range of values \nincluded) and for any further work we do with the numerical features (in which we might drop outliers).\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-4e061444-cc57-4b8f-bcf1-92465c959c1b","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"### 3D SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF OBJECTS IN LEO\n\n# create a copy of the in_orbit dataframe \ndf = in_orbit.copy()\n\n# subset dataframe to only those points that are not outliers\n# determined via the graphs in the cell above\n# easier for viewing, and removes objects that may be at \n# Lagrange points (not near Earth), for example\ndf = df[df['APOGEE'] < 2500]\ndf = df[df['PERIGEE'] < 1700]\n\n# select a random set of 2000 datapoints for easier viewing\ndf = df.loc[np.random.choice(df.index, 2000, replace=False)]\na = df['APOGEE'].to_numpy()\nb = df['PERIGEE'].to_numpy()\n\n# randomly generate a number between 0 and 2pi\n# this is essentially the longitude of the object's\n# location around Earth\nomega = 2*np.pi * np.random.random(len(a))\n\n# using the formula for an ellipse in polar coordinates,\n# find the position of the space object such that it falls on\n# the object's elliptical flight path (given by APOGEE and PERIGEE)\n# and is at the randomly sampled longitude identified above\nb_sq = np.multiply(np.square(b), np.square(np.cos(omega)))\na_sq = np.multiply(np.square(a), np.square(np.sin(omega)))\n\nr = np.divide(np.multiply(a,b), np.sqrt(a_sq + b_sq))\n\n# store list of positions and longitudes in new features\ndf['R'] = r\ndf['OMEGA'] = omega\n\n# SPACE OBJECTS LAUNCHED BY US\ndf_y = df[df['COUNTRY'] == \"US\"]\n\n# convert from polar to Cartesian in order to plot\nx = np.multiply(np.multiply(df_y['R'], np.cos(df_y['INCLINATION'])), np.cos(df_y['OMEGA']))\ny = np.multiply(np.multiply(df_y['R'], np.cos(df_y['INCLINATION'])), np.sin(df_y['OMEGA']))\nz = np.multiply(df_y['R'],  np.sin(df_y['INCLINATION']))\n\n# same thing, except for OBJECTS FROM NON-US COUNTRIES\ndf_non = df[df['COUNTRY'] != \"US\"]\n\nx2 = np.multiply(np.multiply(df_non['R'], np.cos(df_non['INCLINATION'])), np.cos(df_non['OMEGA']))\ny2 = np.multiply(np.multiply(df_non['R'], np.cos(df_non['INCLINATION'])), np.sin(df_non['OMEGA']))\nz2 = np.multiply(df_non['R'],  np.sin(df_non['INCLINATION']))\n\n# plot with plotly \nplotly.offline.init_notebook_mode()\n\n# create trace for \"US object\" datapoints\n# same thing below for non-US and for the Earth\ntrace = go.Scatter3d(\n    x=x, \n    y=y,  \n    z=z, \n    name = \"US Objects\",\n    mode='markers',\n    marker={\n        'size': 5,\n        'opacity': 0.8,\n    }\n)\n\ntrace1 = go.Scatter3d(\n    x=x2,  \n    y=y2,  \n    z=z2,  \n    name = \"Non-US Objects\",\n    mode='markers',\n    marker={\n        'size': 5,\n        'opacity': 0.8,\n        'color': 'green',\n    }\n)\n\ntrace2 = go.Scatter3d(\n    x=[0],  \n    y=[0],  \n    z=[0],  \n    name = 'Earth',\n    mode='markers',\n    marker={\n        'size': 20,\n        'opacity': 0.8,\n        'color': 'brown',\n    }\n)\n\nfig = make_subplots(specs=[[{\"type\": 'scene'}]])\nfig.add_trace(trace)\nfig.add_trace(trace1)\nfig.add_trace(trace2)\nfig['layout'].update(height = 600, width = 800, title = 'Debris Spatial Distribution',xaxis=dict(\n      tickangle=-90\n    ))\nfig.show()\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-bf39c0ca-ed7d-492f-9ad9-834991824e90","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The 3D graph above depicts the spatial distribution of functional space objects currently in orbit around the Earth. \nThe points are color coded such that blue points represent US objects and green points represent non-US satellites.\nThe graph was constructed via Plotly, which we learned in order to implement a clear, interactive 3D plot.\nA random sample of 2,000 datapoints (space objects) is selected, given that the total 20,000+ observations would \noverwhelm the plot. Moreover, objects are plotted at a random location along their elliptical flight paths -- all\nwe are given in the dataset is inclination and distance from Earth (\"r\" in polar coordinates). Thus, randomly sampling\nfrom along the flight path returns the location of the object. This graph tells us a few important things: first,\nwe see that while the preponderence of space objects are not from the US, the US has launched most of the furthest\nobjects from the center of te Earth. Indeed, non-US objects are clumped above the Poles, while the US' are either more \ndispersed or located in a ring above what may be a Tropic. Secondly, space is _very_ dense. Recall that this is only\na fraction of the total data. Assuming the rest are distributed similarly (which we can assume so long as our sample\nis representative), space around the Poles, particularly, is in short supply (of course, our plot does not do a good\njob of quantifying just how much empty space there is, but when we also consider that decayed objects are not included\non the chart, we understand that this space is indeed quite dense). Third, this type of plot may be useful in\nour later analyses -- we can change the color coding to signify launch date, per se, rather than country of origin. \nIn this case, we would be able to assess spatially, in 3D, changes in distribution, object density, and object distance\nover time.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-af60f47b-506a-4de1-b595-46a248ee3ac2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# FUNDING AND SPACE ACTIVITY\n# read in dataset with
